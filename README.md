# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
 
**Overview of Project**

I have reviewed the data of campaigns in regards to theater plays so that my client Louise can have a better understanding of the results of campaigns relating to their launch dates and funding goals.  Louise had a goal of $2,885 for the play Fever and was short $400 and is interested in finding trends so that she can be successful in future campaigns.  Through this analysis, I was able to identify some trends as explained in my results below.

**Purpose**

**Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date**

After reviewing the data, there were multiple subcategories included so I focused on just theater campagins.  I wanted to look at the results of theater campaigns based on launch date so I created a pivot table to look at the data by month for theater only.  From there, I fit the data into a line chart to be able to predict the best time to launch a theater play campaign as you can see in the graph below.

**Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals**

After looking at the outcomes by month, I wanted to see if the goal amount was relative to the outcome of the goal.  I did this by creating a histogram and creating a line chart so that you can easily see the success and fail of the campagins by dollar range as you can see in the graph below.

**Challenges and Difficulties Encountered**

I did not have any big challenges but I was off on my total projects which I noticed because I added a test figure.  From there, I reviewed the data and found that I was off on the greater than $50,000.  In my formula, I only had greater than and needed to also add equal to.  If I did not have the test figure in, my numbers would have been off.

**Results**

As I reviewed the graph labeled "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date" I noticed that the successful and failed outcomes move in a similar trend and they intersect in December.  In December, there is a 50/50 chance of having a successful campaign.  May, June and July are the most successful months for a campaign.

The Outcomes Based on Goal graph shows the percentage successful and failed based on dollar range.  The highest percentage of successful campaigns are those under $5,000 which is where almost 69% of the total campaigns fall into.  From over $5,000 to $24,999, the rate of success ranges from 45% to 55%.  The amount of campagins over $25,000 is only 4.01% of the total projects. 

I noticed that there is a column for currency so people could be assuming this is all in US dollars or their currency depending on what country they are in.  If the dollars are in the respective country dollars, this would skew the analysis.

As far as the analysis, I would have also looked at the outcomes by date by year to see if there were any years that were greater than others.  Also, I would have looked at the outcomes by date and the goals by country as well to determine if there were certain countries that had higher goals.  The outcomes based on goals does have outliers due to the high goal dollars which skews the data shown by launch date.  I would have done another pivot table showing total goal and total pledge and also done a bar chart so that I could see if the pledged amount was greater than the goal amount by month.  This could help when doing future campaigns and the potential goal that could be reached.
