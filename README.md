# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
 
**Overview of Project**

I have reviewed the data of campaigns in regards to theatre plays so that my client Louise can have a better understanding of the results of campaigns relating to their launch dates and funding goals.  Louise had a goal of $2,885 for the play Fever and was short $400 and is interested in finding trends so that she can be successful in future campaigns.  Through this analysis, I was able to identify some trends as explained in my analysis below.

**Purpose**

**Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date**

The data provided was for multiple subcategories so after reviewing the data, I created a pivot table first to show the total category of theater campaigns by month and whether they were successful, failed or canceled.  From there, I created a graph so that you can visually see the trends for the outcomes of the theatre campaigns by month which you can see below.  

**Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals**

After looking at the outcomes by month, I wanted to see if the goal amount was related to the outcome.  I did this by creating a histogram and creating a chart so that you can easily see the success and fail of the campagins by dollar range.

**Challenges and Difficulties Encountered**

I did not have any challenges but I was off on my total projects so I added a test figure.  From there, I reviewed the data and found that I was off on the Greater than $50,000.  In my formula, I only had greater than and needed to also add equal to.  If I did not have the test figure in, my numbers would have been off.


**Results**

You may notice that the successful and failed outcomes move in a similar trend and they intersect in December.  In December, there is a 50/50 chance of having a successful campaign.  May, June and July are the most successful months for a campaign.

In additional to the most successful months of campaigns, I took a look at whether or not the amount of the goal as an effect on the outcome.  The highest percentage of successful campaigns are those under $5,000 which is where almost 69% of the total campaigns.  From over $5,000 to $24,999, the rate of success ranges from 45% to 55%.  The amount of campagins over $25,000 is only 4.01% of the total projects. 

I noticed that there is a column for currency so people could be assuming this is all in US dollars or their currency depending on what country they are in.  As far as the analysis, I would have also looked at the outcomes by date by the year to see if there were any years that were greater than others.  Also, I would have looked at the outcomes by date and the goals by country as well to determine if there were certain countries that had higher goals.  The outcomes based on goals does have some outliers which can skew the data shown by launch date.  I would have done another pivot charge showing total goal and total pledge and also done a bar chart so that I could see if the pledged amount was greater than the goal amount by month.  This could help when doing future campaigns and the potential goal that could be reached.
