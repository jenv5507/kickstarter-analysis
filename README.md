# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
 
**Overview of Project**

I have reviewed the data of campaigns in regards to theatre plays so that my client Louise can have a better understanding of the results of campaigns relating to their launch dates and funding goals.  Louise had a goal of $2,885 for the play Fever and was short $400 and is interested in finding trends so that she can be successful in future campaigns.  Through this analysis, I was able to identify some trends as explained in my analysis below.

**Analysis and Challenges**

The data provided was for multiple subcategories so after reviewing the data, I created a pivot table first to show the total category of theater campaigns by month and whether they were successful, failed or canceled.  From there, I created a graph so that you can visually see the trends for the outcomes of the theatre campaigns by month which you can see below.  You may notice that the successful and failed outcomes move in a similar trend and they intersect in December.  In December, there is a 50/50 chance of having a successful campaign.  May, June and July are the most successful months for a campaign.
