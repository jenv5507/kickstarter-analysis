# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
 
**Overview of Project**

I have reviewed the data of campaigns in regards to theatre plays so that my client Louise can have a better understanding of the results of campaigns relating to their launch dates and funding goals.  Louise had a goal of $2,885 for the play Fever and was short $400 and is interested in finding trends so that she can be successful in future campaigns.  Through this analysis, I was able to identify some trends.

**Analysis and Challenges**

The data provided was for multiple subcategories so after reviewing the data, I created a pivot table first to show the total category of theater campaigns by month and whether they were successful, failed or canceled.  From there, I created a graph so that you can visually see the trends for the outcomes of the theatre campaigns.
